## IOMW 2025 [Under construction!]

Information here pertains to the April 2025 demonstration of the IRW at the [IOMW conference](https://www.iomw.net/) held in Boulder, CO. Slides for this training can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOcMpaRwBfBF9xBdgdO6KBHm7xiGlq6n9WczI2oCrX8/edit?slide=id.g3334d2a9abd_0_4#slide=id.g3334d2a9abd_0_4). Prior to attending the conference, please go through the following checklist:

* We will be working with R. Make sure you have R installed. We will also use some specific packages that you will need to install. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ben-domingue/irw/blob/main/training/iomw2025/00_packages.R).

* Please download the zip file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mplmps10t7z7p8ljyo6km/tables.zip?rlkey=mde08yuex0jjvr80wchercb6b&e=1&dl=0). This file will make it possible to follow along without depending on Redivis authentication. 

* There will be several options for working with the data. One simple option is to use the data downloaded in the previous step (everyone can use that option as a fallback as needed). But there are additional options available that you may want to consider.

  + You can use a Redivis notebook. To get started, go [here](https://redivis.com/workflows/sdv7-7r839my4g/notebooks/vma9-89a2etg40). If you have not previously used Redivis you will need to create an account. After doing so, you can attempt to run the code (and should be good to if you can see the first few rows of this dataset).

  + You can use `irwpkg`. To do so, you will need to follow the instructions shown [here](https://hansorlee.github.io/irwpkg/). In particular, look at the information about [Redivis authentication](https://hansorlee.github.io/irwpkg/#important-redivis-authentication). If you plan to work with the data this way, you can test that you are set up to do so by trying to successfully execute the following:
    ```
    df<-irwpkg::irw_fetch("DART_Brysbaert_2020_1")
    head(df)
    ```

In practice, `irwpkg` is likely to be the best way of interacting with the IRW data given that you can work in your local environment and utilize the filtering techniques we are developing. Please let me know (email ben.domingue@gmail.com) if you have any problems/questions!
