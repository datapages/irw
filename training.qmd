## IOMW 2025

Information here pertains to the April 2025 demonstration of the IRW at the [IOMW conference](https://www.iomw.net/) held in Boulder, CO. Slides for this training can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOcMpaRwBfBF9xBdgdO6KBHm7xiGlq6n9WczI2oCrX8/edit?slide=id.g3334d2a9abd_0_4#slide=id.g3334d2a9abd_0_4). Prior to attending the conference, please go through the following checklist:

* **Install R and the necessary packages.** We will be working with R. Make sure you have [R installed](https://www.r-project.org/). We will also use some specific packages that you will need to install. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ben-domingue/irw/blob/main/training/iomw2025/00_packages.R).

* **Download the necessary data.** Please download the zip file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mplmps10t7z7p8ljyo6km/tables.zip?rlkey=mde08yuex0jjvr80wchercb6b&e=1&dl=0) and store is so that you can access it readily during the training. This file will make it possible to follow along without depending on Redivis authentication. 

* **Prepare to interact with IRW data.** I will discuss several methods of interacting with IRW data. These methods require a few minutes of preparation. You only need to choose one of them and *I recommend you try the second*.

  + You can use a Redivis notebook. To get started, go [here](https://redivis.com/workflows/sdv7-7r839my4g/notebooks/vma9-89a2etg40). If you have not previously used Redivis you will need to create an account. After doing so, you can attempt to run the code (and should be good to go if you can run the lines showing the first few rows of the dataset). To run the code, you will first need to `fork` the notebook (choose `clone this workflow`) and then you should be able to 'start notebook' and execute the code blocks.

  + You can use `irwpkg` (the preferred option). To do so, you will need to follow the instructions shown [here](https://hansorlee.github.io/irwpkg/). In particular, look at the information about [Redivis authentication](https://hansorlee.github.io/irwpkg/#important-redivis-authentication). If you plan to work with the data this way, you can test that you are set up to do so by trying to successfully execute the following in your local R environment:
    ```
    df<-irwpkg::irw_fetch("DART_Brysbaert_2020_1")
    head(df)
    ```

We recommend working with `irwpkg` given that you can work in your local environment and utilize the filtering techniques we are developing. Please let me know (email ben.domingue at gmail.com) if you have any problems/questions!
