As such, they play a critical role in increasing the extent to which science is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The IRW data standard is meant to be a straightforward way of standardizing item response data such that it can be readily used by interested researchers in a wide variety of psychometric analyses."

Note that the typesetting of the data elements is consistent with that of the IRW.\n\nid This is a persistent identifer for the focal unit, i.e. the thing being measured. This will typically be a person but in some cases may be, for example, a word (when interest is in establishing some property of the word).\nitem This is a persistent identifier for the probe being used to measure. There are some cases wherein a unique item identifier cannot be identified; for more information on these cases see the discussion of trials below.\nresp This is the item responses. It is coded as a numeric value that can be directly utilized in various psychometric models. Given its centrality, we make a few additional points:\n\nResponse values that were imputed in the original data have been removed.\nWithin an item, values are meant to be consistently coded so that higher numbers indicate a consistently meanginful change in a response (i.e., higher numbers indicate stronger agreement). However, values may load on the latent variable in opposite ways across items (i.e., higher numbers may indicate strong agreement for some items and weaker agreement for others)."

    "text": "Other elements\nThese elements are optional features of IRW datasets. When IRW datasets have these columns, they have been consistently formatted as per the data standards described here.\n\nrt The response time used to produce an item response is coded in seconds.\ndate The calendar time at which a response was produced is included. Coding of this variable is done in two ways. In some cases, there were only relative dates (e.g., 30 days into data collection). In that case, we convert to the number of seconds since the first piece of data in the dataset was collected). In cases where more exact information was given (e.g., 1:30PM 03/04/2008), we convert to Unix time (i.e., seconds since JAN 01 1970. (UTC)).\nqmatrix When items are classified into a small number of skills (i.e., for the purposes of cognitive diagnostic modeling ), we have included these item-level classifications. Note that the column headers will be qmatrix1, …, qmatrixN when there are N skills.\nrater In scenarios wherein the focal unit is being rated by other observers (perhaps along multiple dimensions), an identifier associated with the rater producing the rating.\nwave In settings wherein data is collected longitudinally (but precise timing as in date is not available), we indicate the wave of data collection. Values are ordered such that larger values represent data collected at a later date relative to smaller values. Note that this is also used to indicate pre/post treatment in the case of data collected from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\ntreat An indicator of whether a respondent was in a treatment group (1=Yes) in an experimental study (e.g., an RCT or quasiexperiment).\ncov_ Covariates that are invariant for the foci of measurement (denoted by id; as an example, common covariates for persons may be gender and age) will be identified via the cov_ prefix. NOTE: This was implemented as of V11.25; data added before that may not be reverse-compatible with this standardization element.\nitemcov_ Covariates that are invariant for the measurement probe. NOTE: This was implemented as of V16.1; data added before that may not be reverse-compatible with this standardization element.\nitem_family An identifier for groups of items that potentially have family resemblances such that assumptions related to local independence may be violated. Examples include items with a testlet structure, items that have common features (e.g., ‘how important is it that people wash their hands regularly?’ vesrus ‘how important is it that you wash your hands regularly’), or items that are clones of each other. Each element of a family of items will have a unique identifier (e.g., items in the first testlet have id 1, items in the second testlet have id 2, etc) and items that are not a member of a family will be NA. NOTE: This was implemented as of V11.25; data added before that may not be reverse-compatible with this standardization element."

Some of the below may be considered more experimental features of the IRW; more information about these data will be forthcoming.\n\nProcess data: In general, a single row of data in the IRW corresponds to a unque response from an individual to an item. In the context of ‘process data’, more information about a response is available. In such cases, responses have identifers that can be used to understand the sequence of actions that led to a given response.\nTrials: Many constructs in cognitive psychology are measured via repeated trials of similar tasks wherein the probes either do not vary or vary in terms of some quantifiable feature of the stimulus. In such cases, the item column is uninformative and the columns beginning trial_ will contain information about the different trials."

If multiple groups are assessed via the same scale, these data can be put into a single file (if desired, a column indicating group membership can be added).\n\nWhile we have tried to offer generic guidance on formatting data to the IRW standard, there are innumerable idiosyncracies that may merit additional conversation.

Prior to attending the conference, please go through the following checklist:\n\nInstall R and the necessary packages. We will be working with R. Make sure you have R installed. We will also use some specific packages that you will need to install. Please follow the instructions here.\nDownload the necessary data. Please download the zip file here and store is so that you can access it readily during the training. This file will make it possible to follow along without depending on Redivis authentication.\nPrepare to interact with IRW data. I will discuss several methods of interacting with IRW data. These methods require a few minutes of preparation. You only need to choose one of them and I recommend you try the second.\n\nYou can use a Redivis notebook. To get started, go here. If you have not previously used Redivis you will need to create an account. After doing so, you can attempt to run the code (and should be good to go if you can run the lines showing the first few rows of the dataset). To run the code, you will first need to fork the notebook (choose clone this workflow) and then you should be able to ‘start notebook’ and execute the code blocks.\nYou can use irw (the preferred option). To do so, you will need to follow the instructions shown here. If you plan to work with the data this way, you can test that you are set up to do so by trying to successfully execute the following in your local R environment:\ndf&lt;-irw::irw_fetch(\"DART_Brysbaert_2020_1\")\nhead(df)\n\n\nWe recommend working with irw given that you can work in your local environment and utilize the filtering techniques we are developing. Please let me know (email ben.domingue at gmail.com) if you have any problems/questions!"

    "text": "Simulation is a powerful way to understand how psychometric models behave under different conditions. But many simulation studies make a simplifying assumption — that item difficulties follow a perfectly normal or uniform distribution. In reality, real-world measures rarely look that simple. Some have mostly easy items, others have clusters of hard ones, and some even show multiple peaks in difficulty levels.\nThis tutorial introduces a practical way to simulate realistic item difficulties based on empirical data drawn from IRW. Using the irw R package, you can easily generate item difficulties that reflect the diversity seen in real assessments rather than relying on artificial assumptions."

    "text": "A Small Simulation: Why Should We Care About Difficulty Distributions?\nWe ran a small simulation to show why the item difficulty distributions matter. In particular, we examined how different distributions affect the sample size required for accurate parameter estimation.\nWe used the empirical difficulty distributions from each of the datasets in the IRW pool. For each dataset, the procedure consisted of the following steps:\n\nGenerate item difficulties: We sampled 50 items according to the empirical difficulty distribution from that dataset (as shown in the ridge plot above), and repeated this process 100 replications.\nSimulate response data and estimate parameters: For a given sample size \\(N\\), we generated response data using a simple Rasch model with the known difficulties. We then estimated item difficulties from the simulated responses and computed the correlation between estimated and true parameters.\nSearch for the minimal sufficient sample size: To efficiently determine how many respondents were needed to achieve a reliable recovery, we used a binary search between \\(N\\) = 50 and 10,000. The search terminated once the average correlation across replications exceeded 0.95 and the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the search interval was less than 10.\n\nThe sample size requirement analysis demonstrates the strong influence of item difficulty distribution on model estimation. The results (shown below) revealed notable differences across datasets: for some difficulty distributions, accurate recovery could be achieved with fewer than one hundred respondents, whereas for others, several hundred were needed to reach the same level of accuracy. This variation is independent of the number of items (given that we always sampled 50 items). When the standard deviation (SD) of item difficulty is below 1, a smaller SD indicates less variation among item difficulties, which requires a larger sample size. As the SD increases, the required sample size initially decreases, but once the SD becomes too large, the required sample size begins to increase again."
