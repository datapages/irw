We welcome contribution of new datasets to the IRW!


## Contributing data

#### If you would like to contribute data, **please feel out the (brief) form [here](https://forms.gle/DaTKe2bpZw3vZqj77)**.

We will take information about any data that you think may be worth including in the IRW. Inclusion will be easier if the data is already in a format consistent with the [IRW data standard](standard.qmd). Below we preovide information on how to construct such a dataset.

## Constructing an IRW-compliant dataset

Below are critical instructions for formatting data for the IRW. More details are available [here](standard.qmd). . 

1. Numeric values of a response should be meaningful. For example, missing values cannot be coded as numbers (e.g., -9).

2. Please check that the `id` and `item` identifers have an appropriate number of unique values.

3. Additional data elements (e.g., `rt`, `date`, `wave`, `rater`, `qmatrix`) should all be formatted as specified above. 

4. If there are multiple scales available, the responses need to be split into mutiple files (one per scale). If multiple groups are assessed via the same scale, these data can be put into a single file (if desired, a column indicating group membership can be added).

While we have tried to offer generic guidance on formatting data to the IRW standard, there are innumerable idiosyncracies that may merit additional conversation. To discuss specific  issues associated with your formatting your data to the IRW standard, please feel free to each out to us at `itemresponsewarehouse@stanford.edu`. We would be happy to talk more! You can also use the [IRW Dataset Builder](https://irw-dataset-builder.streamlit.app/) that will help port data to the IRW data standard if you like.
