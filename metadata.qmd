title: "Metadata for IRW tables"
---

We supplement the data in the IRW tables with various kinds of metadata about the tables. For clarity, we separately describe the qualitative and quantitative metadata. 

## Quantitative Metadata

A variety of features of the tables (e.g., the number of rows) are pre-computed (using [this code](https://github.com/itemresponsewarehouse/misc/blob/main/metadata/01_metadata.R)) to help users select datasets with desirable features. We provide information on:

- 'n_responses' The number of rows in the table.
- 'n_categories' The number of unique values of the `resp` column in the table. [Note: This needs to be treated with some care given that `NA` values are considered a level.]
- 'n_participants' The number of objects being measured.
- 'n_items' The number of probes being used to measure.
- 'responses_per_participant' The average number of responses for an object of measurement.
- 'responses_per_item' The average number of responses for a probe.
- 'density' The average number of responses for an individual measurement object to an individual probe.
- 'variables' The names of all the columns in the table.

## Qualitative Metadata

The IRW tables have been annotated with additional information about the sample of objects being measured and the nature of the probes being used to measure. For each table, we describe:

- 'age range' The age range of the measurement objects (when they are humans).
- `child age (for child-focused studies)` Additional information on the age range of child-focused studies.
- `sample` A description of the sample of objects (e.g., is it a convenience sample?). 
- `construct type` A classification of the construct type (e.g., is this a cognitive measure?). 
- `measurement tool` The type of measure (e.g., are these ratings? collected responses?). 
- `item format` The format of the item.
- `primary language(s)` The language used in the assessment. 
- `construct name` A formal description of the construct (from the original source).

Note that this information was produced by human raters; some degree of subjectivity should be expected. 

## Querying IRW tables

Given the volume of tables in the IRW and their heterogeneity, being able to effectively query IRW tables is essential. To do so, we recommend using the `irw::irw_filter()` function. Information on that function is [here](https://itemresponsewarehouse.github.io/Rpkg/reference/irw_filter.html). Below we provide a variety of simple use cases; once a user has identified the appropriate tables, `irw::irw_fetch()` can be used to easily download them.

## R

```{r}
#| echo: true
irw::irw_filter(n_participants=c(100000,Inf)) #Those tables with more than 100000 participants (using default density filter)
irw::irw_filter(n_participants=c(100000,Inf),density=NULL) #All tables with more than 100000 participants
irw::irw_filter(n_categories=c(10,Inf),density=NULL) #Tables with responses in 10 or more categories
irw::irw_filter(var='rt') #Tables with response time data
irw::irw_filter(age_range="Child (<18y)") #Tables with child-focused data
```
