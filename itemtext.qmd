## The standard for item information

We have begun to incorporate the text of the items used to produce stimuli in the IRW. This information is available [here](https://redivis.com/datasets/07b6-11dggrv8c). These data are structured as follows:

- `table` This identifier can be used to link to the IRW response data.

- `section_id` This is an identifier for a group of items that share a common context. It is conceptually equivalent to the `item_family` element in the IRW standard and is used to annotate information about, for example, testlets (i.e., items grouped under a single reading passage).

- `item` This is a persistent identifier for *the probe being used to measure*, matching the `item` field in the core IRW dataset.

- `instrument` This is the full, human-readable name or title for the instrument identified by the `table` column.

- `instructions` This contains the literal text of the instructions provided to the participant for the overall instrument.

- `section_prompt` This contains the literal text of a shared prompt, such as a reading passage, that applies to all items within a given `section_id`.

- `item_text` This is the literal text of the specific prompt or question associated with an `item`.

- `correct_response` This is the scoring key for a given `item`. This field is left blank for items that do not have a correct response. For items with multiple correct answers, values are separated by a semicolon.

- `option_text` This is the literal text for a specific response option available for an item.

- `resp` This is the response value assigned to a specific `option_text`. It should match the numeric, ordinal `resp` value found in the response-level IRW dataset.


## Incorporation with the IRW response data

This dataset is designed to be interoperable with the core IRW item response data. Specifically, the `table` identifer should allow for merging across these two data resources. Researchers can link these item text records to response-level data using the `item` field, which serves as a shared, persistent identifier across both datasets.

To incorporate response option text, the `resp` field in this dataset provides a mapping between response codes (consistent with `resp` in the response-level data) and their corresponding option_text. This allows users to reconstruct full item presentations or analyze response behavior with access to the literal item wording.

## R

```{r}
#| echo: true
items<-irw::irw_itemtext("gilbert_meta_49")
df<-irw::irw_fetch("gilbert_meta_49")
df<-merge(items,df)
head(df)
```

Merging these datasets allows for a more complete view of the data, including:

- The full wording of each item and response option
- Analysis of how item phrasing may influence responses
- Richer visualizations and content-based filtering
