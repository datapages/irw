title: "Item Text"
---

We have begun to incorporate the text of the items used to produce stimuli in the IRW. This information is available [here](https://redivis.com/datasets/07b6-11dggrv8c). These data are structured as follows:

- `table` This identifier can be used to link to the IRW response data.
- `section_id` Some measures are split into several assessments and this identifer distinguishes them. 
- `item` The  identifer of the probe which can be linked to the `item` identifer in the IRW response data. 
- `instrument` Information about the measure. 
- `instructions` Instructions given regarding the overall measure. 
- `section_prompt` Prompt text specific to a section. 
- `item_text` The 'stem' text of the item. 
- `correct_response` ???
- `option_text` Text for the specific response options.
- `resp` The value for the response.
