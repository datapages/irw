title: "Item Text"
---

We have begun to incorporate the text of the items used to produce stimuli in the IRW. This information is available [here](https://redivis.com/datasets/07b6-11dggrv8c). These data are structured as follows:

- table
- `section_id`
- `item`
- `instrument`
- `instructions`
- `section_prompt`
- `item_text`
- `correct_response`
- `option_text`
- `resp`
