title: "Item Text"
---

We have begun to incorporate the text of the items used to produce stimuli in the IRW. This information is available [here](https://redivis.com/datasets/07b6-11dggrv8c). These data are structured as follows:

- `table` This identifier can be used to link to the IRW response data.

- `section_id` This is an identifier for a group of items that share a common context. It is conceptually equivalent to the `item_family` element in the IRW standard and is used for things like testlets or items grouped under a single reading passage.

- `item` This is a persistent identifier for *the probe being used to measure*, matching the `item` field in the core IRW dataset.

- `instrument` This is the full, human-readable name or title for the instrument identified by the `table` column.

- `instructions` This contains the literal text of the instructions provided to the participant for the overall instrument.

- `section_prompt` This contains the literal text of a shared prompt, such as a reading passage, that applies to all items within a given `section_id`.

- `item_text` This is the literal text of the specific prompt or question associated with an `item`.

- `correct_response` This is the scoring key for a given `item`. This field is left blank for items that do not have a correct response. For items with multiple correct answers, values are separated by a semicolon.

- `option_text` This is the literal text for a specific response option available for an item.

- `resp` This is the value assigned to a specific `option_text` (e.g., A, B, C or 0, 1, 2). It provides the link between the literal text of an option and its corresponding value in the core `resp` data.
